# Youtube-Video-Downloader
A wee script that makes use of youtube's blob store api to download videos. Handy for when you want to download large 4k YT videos and not have to compress the living crap out of them as would happen when using online YT downloaders.
It's still pretty hacky and taped together, if anyone cares enough about it let me know and I will refactor it.
